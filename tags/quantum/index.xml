      <title>Quantum #7 - Grover</title>

      <description>This is the seventh post of a series of posts about Quantum Computing with Qiskit. The area is very new and the SDK is changing constantly, but hopefully, the series can help you learn a bit about quantum and help me reinforce a couple concepts.
The goal of this post is to discuss Grover’s algorithm. It is an algorithm to solve unstructured search in \(O(\sqrt N)\), which is a quadratic speedup over the classical \(O(N)\) solution.</description>

      <description>This is the sixth post of a series of posts about Quantum Computing with Qiskit. The area is very new and the SDK is changing constantly, but hopefully, the series can help you learn a bit about quantum and help me reinforce a couple concepts.
The goal of this post is to discuss how to discover a hidden string in a black box using Bernstein-Vazirani’s algorithm. There is also a connection between this algorithm and Deutsch-Jozsa’s algorithm, which was discussed in the last post.</description>

      <description>This is the fifth post of a series of posts about Quantum Computing with Qiskit. The area is very new and the SDK is changing constantly, but hopefully, the series can help you learn a bit about quantum and help me reinforce a couple concepts.
The goal of this post is to continue the discussion of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, starting off where we stopped on part 1.
Deutsch-Jozsa problem After having introduced the Deutsch problem, we will now introduce the Deutsch-Jozsa which is a generalization of the Deutsch problem.</description>

      <description>This is the fourth post of a series of posts about Quantum Computing with Qiskit. The area is very new and the SDK is changing constantly, but hopefully, the series can help you learn a bit about quantum and help me reinforce a couple concepts.
The goal of this post is to discuss the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which was one of the very first quantum algorithms. Even though it solves a very artificial problem, its main purpose is to answer: is there an advantage in using quantum computers?</description>

      <title>Quantum #3 - Superdense Coding</title>

      <description>This is the third post of a series of posts about Quantum Computing with Qiskit. The area is very new and the SDK is changing constantly, but hopefully, the series can help you learn a bit about quantum and help me reinforce a couple concepts.
The goal of this post is to discuss superdense coding, which can be seen as the opposite of quantum teleportation.
Sending bits with qubits Imagine that Alice wants to send two classical bits \(b_{0}b_{1}\) to Bob.</description>

      <description>This is the second post of a series of posts about Quantum Computing with Qiskit. The area is very new and the SDK is changing constantly, but hopefully, the series can help you learn a bit about quantum and help me reinforce a couple concepts.
The goal of this post is to discuss quantum teleportation, one of the most basic protocols for communication in quantum computing.
Teleportation and the problem it solves Imagine that Alice has a qubit \(| \psi \rangle = \alpha | 0 \rangle + \beta | 1 \rangle\), where both \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are unknown.</description>

      <description>This is the first post of a series of posts about Quantum Computing with Qiskit. The area is very new and the SDK is changing constantly, but hopefully, the series can help you learn a bit about quantum and help me reinforce a couple concepts.
The goal of this post is to introduce a more hands-on approach to quantum computing using Qiskit. For a friendly introduction to quantum computing in general, I recommend the essay Quantum computing for the very curious by Matuschak and Nielsen.</description>
